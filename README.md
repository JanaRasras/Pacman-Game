# Pacman Game

This code is designed to create an engaging Pac-Man game using Scratch, a programming language aimed at teaching kids programming. It consists of nine distinct parts, each dedicated to teaching new programming skills and preparing the young learners for the next level in their programming journey. As they progress through the parts, they acquire a deeper understanding of programming concepts, eventually culminating in their ability to develop a complete and fully functional Pac-Man game.
